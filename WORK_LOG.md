| April 5 |   9-10pm    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   I tried to write abstract, efficient code. |
| Dec 3   | 2:10-2:30pm | Began coding. Current idea is to have a different states for the expansion algorithm to be in, such as a letter state, a normal character state, and eventually a common word state. Started with the letter state, where I'm using 6 bits to represent each letter instead of the normal 8. |
| Dec 3   | 2:30-3:00pm |                            Continued working on letter state, as well as the normal character state. It's a little tricky to figure out how to send the compressor to different states at the right time, but I'm working through it. Also started a little work on the expansion algorithm. |
