| April 5    |    9-10pm     |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           I tried to write abstract, efficient code. |
| December 3 |  2:10-2:30pm  |                                                                                         Began coding. Current idea is to have a different states for the expansion algorithm to be in, such as a letter state, a normal character state, and eventually a common word state. Started with the letter state, where I'm using 6 bits to represent each letter instead of the normal 8. |
| December 3 |  2:30-3:00pm  |                                                                                                                    Continued working on letter state, as well as the normal character state. It's a little tricky to figure out how to send the compressor to different states at the right time, but I'm working through it. Also started a little work on the expansion algorithm. |
| December 5 | 9:55-10:40pm  |                                                                                                                                                                            Continued working on states. It's actually really tricky to get right. I moved onto the expander, but now I'm getting a bunch of weird exceptions that I'm  not sure how to fix. Will keep working on it. |
| December 5 | 11:45-12:30pm |  It took while to figure out the error. It turns out that the isAlphabetic function includes characters with accents, which won't fit in my 6-bits reserved for letters. I just manually wrote in the ascii values and it runs without error. Finished the expansion, but unfortunately doesn't work. My expanded binary file bears no resemblance to the original. WIll keep at it. |
