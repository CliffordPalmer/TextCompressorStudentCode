| April 5     |    9-10pm     |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  I tried to write abstract, efficient code. |
| December 3  |  2:10-2:30pm  |                                                                                                                                                                Began coding. Current idea is to have a different states for the expansion algorithm to be in, such as a letter state, a normal character state, and eventually a common word state. Started with the letter state, where I'm using 6 bits to represent each letter instead of the normal 8. |
| December 3  |  2:30-3:00pm  |                                                                                                                                                                                           Continued working on letter state, as well as the normal character state. It's a little tricky to figure out how to send the compressor to different states at the right time, but I'm working through it. Also started a little work on the expansion algorithm. |
| December 5  | 9:55-10:40pm  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Continued working on states. It's actually really tricky to get right. I moved onto the expander, but now I'm getting a bunch of weird exceptions that I'm  not sure how to fix. Will keep working on it. |
| December 5  | 11:45-12:30pm |                                                                         It took while to figure out the error. It turns out that the isAlphabetic function includes characters with accents, which won't fit in my 6-bits reserved for letters. I just manually wrote in the ascii values and it runs without error. Finished the expansion, but unfortunately doesn't work. My expanded binary file bears no resemblance to the original. WIll keep at it. |
| December 9  | 11:25-11:55am |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     We learned the theory today. It's a little confusing, but I downloaded the TST code and began trying to work on the compress algorithm. |
| December 11 |  9:25-9:55am  |                                                                                                                                 Made a lot of progress this class period. Spent a little time going around in circles until I realized that I needed to add each letter as a possible prefix in the TST. Pretty straightforward after that. Compressor is (hopefully, can't tell until I test with the expander) working, and started working on expansion. |
| December 11 | 11:00-11:30pm |                                                                                                               Picked right up from where I left off in class. "finished" the expansion algorithm, but it didn't work properly. Quickly figured out that I was saving code numbers s part of the prefix for whatever reason by printing out each code and prefix pair. Ran into a ton of errors though, so spent the rest of the time working through those. |
| December 11 | 11:30-12:00am | Kept working through my bugs. It turns out I had an issue in my compression algorithm from earlier, where despite checking when I had filled out all the possible codes, I was still adding additional codes to my TST. Didn't notice before in the smaller test cases. Fixed that, and a few other small bugs, and it seems to work! It's more like a 45-50% compression ratio, not a 30%, but that matches with the ration from the problem set document. |
